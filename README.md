Hashland (hashland.app) is a 3D fantasy metaverse composed of (NFT), which perfectly integrates the design ideas of online games such as World of Warcraft with the blockchain.

## GAMEPLAY

Each NFT item in the game has set a floor price, which can be obtained directly by destroying the NFT item. User can also mortgage NFT items to borrow some tokens, which should be returned in full when redeemed. Mortgage and redemption will burn part of the tokens as a fee.

We have created a method of adding points to the attributes. Once the hero upgrades, he/she will win some (fixed + free) attributes and element points. Players can add points/wash points to the hero, thus strengthening the hero's various game abilities and element confrontation relationships. In this regard, the Game is more interesting and attractive. 

What’ more, the game does not hinder the players’ careers compared with traditional games. We believe that the hindrance of players’ career development from birth is not compliance with the laws of the real world. They are customized to different career by changing weapons of different career.

The core gameplay of the game is mainly designed with regard to heroes, land, and deflationary currencies. Heroes can be upgraded and strengthened to obtain rewards through stake, instance and PVP. Land allows players to build their own homes or game venues for a fee. What’s more, currency runs through the economic system connecting the entire game, and achieves stable economic development through community DAO.

Players can sell/purchase NFT items obtained in the game in the NFT trading market through buy-in prices and bids etc., and each transaction is provided with the floor price of the NFT items.

We ensure 0 private placement, 0 pre-sale, 0 financing of tokens and long-term lock-up of team tokens. Therefore, there is no short-term sell-off risk.
