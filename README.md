# Hashland
The design of the game is inspired by The Sandbox, Decentraland. We believe that an NFT should contain three values (use value, investment value and emotional value). Among them, the use value, the soul of NFT, can release the value of NFT and also determine the value of investment and final height of emotional value.

Making every piece of NFT valuable is our ultimate goal for designing games. Each minted NFT in the game has one or more usage scenarios. Players will continue to use, consume, and strengthen these NFT items to maximize profits during the game. As NFT items continue to be consumed and used, these limited NFTs also become more and more valuable.

In order to allow players to deeply participate in the design of the game, some NFT items in the game are completely controlled and distributed by the players. The higher the hero level of the player, the stronger the attributes of the item created, and the NFT with no value should not be created.

Heroes, land, gear, pets, mounts, items, gold coins, attributes, rarity, total circulation and other data in the game are permanently stored on the blockchain in the form of NFT (ERC721, ERC1155) tokens to achieve complete decentralization of game data. A player's NFT can be accessed, verified, and valued under any circumstances.

We have created a completely deflationary game token economic model. The entire gameplay is designed based on the destruction of HLD tokens. What’s more, the system will count the current destruction, issuance, circulation etc. in a real time manner, allowing users to know the current state of the game economy. 

## GAMEPLAY

Hashland (hashland.app) is a 3D fantasy metaverse composed of (NFT), which perfectly integrates the design ideas of online games such as World of Warcraft with the blockchain.

Each NFT item in the game has set a floor price, which can be obtained directly by destroying the NFT item. User can also mortgage NFT items to borrow some tokens, which should be returned in full when redeemed. Mortgage and redemption will burn part of the tokens as a fee.

We have created a method of adding points to the attributes. Once the hero upgrades, he/she will win some (fixed + free) attributes and element points. Players can add points/wash points to the hero, thus strengthening the hero's various game abilities and element confrontation relationships. In this regard, the Game is more interesting and attractive. 

What’ more, the game does not hinder the players’ careers compared with traditional games. We believe that the hindrance of players’ career development from birth is not compliance with the laws of the real world. They are customized to different career by changing weapons of different career.

The core gameplay of the game is mainly designed with regard to heroes, land, and deflationary currencies. Heroes can be upgraded and strengthened to obtain rewards through stake, instance and PVP. Land allows players to build their own homes or game venues for a fee. What’s more, currency runs through the economic system connecting the entire game, and achieves stable economic development through community DAO.

Players can sell/purchase NFT items obtained in the game in the NFT trading market through buy-in prices and bids etc., and each transaction is provided with the floor price of the NFT items.

We ensure 0 private placement, 0 pre-sale, 0 financing of tokens and long-term lock-up of team tokens. Therefore, there is no short-term sell-off risk.
